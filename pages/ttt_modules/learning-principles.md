## Overview

This module covers the fundamental principles of learning and how they apply to training in bioinformatics and life sciences. Understanding these principles helps trainers create more effective learning experiences.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

- Explain key learning theories and their application to training
- Identify different learning styles and preferences
- Apply cognitive load theory to training design
- Recognize the importance of active learning strategies

## Key Topics

### Learning Theories
- Behaviorism, Cognitivism, and Constructivism
- Adult learning principles (Andragogy)
- Social learning theory

### Cognitive Load
- Working memory limitations
- Intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load
- Strategies to manage cognitive load in training

### Active Learning
- The learning pyramid
- Hands-on activities and practice
- Collaborative learning approaches

## Resources

- Recommended readings on learning theory
- Case studies from bioinformatics training
- Practical exercises for applying learning principles

## Assessment

Participants will demonstrate understanding through:
- Group discussions on learning scenarios
- Design of a short training activity applying learning principles
- Reflection on their own learning experiences
