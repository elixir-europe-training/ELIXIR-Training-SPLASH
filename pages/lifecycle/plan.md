**The planning phase is where every successful training begins!**  
Before any materials are created or sessions are scheduled, this stage helps you clarify **why** the training is needed, **what** its learning focus will be, **who** it is designed for, and **how** it can be delivered effectively.

Planning brings together the core elements that shape the entire training: assessing needs, defining objectives, mapping the curriculum or learning path, allocating resources and funding, setting timelines, and determining both trainers and trainees.

Below, the most important **pedagogical** and **logistical** aspects to consider during the planning phase are outlined.


## What are the pedagogical aspects?

## What are the pedagogical aspects?

- **Training needs analysis:** Identify the specific skills, knowledge, or competencies that the training should address. This involves consulting stakeholders, reviewing existing performance data, and assessing current pedagogical, technical, and logistical requirements to ensure the training is targeted and relevant.

- **Target audience:** Clearly define who will benefit from the training. Consider factors such as their current skill level, prior experience, role, learning preferences, and any prerequisites. Understanding the audience helps tailor the content, examples, and delivery style to maximize engagement and learning outcomes.

- **Learning objectives:** Articulate the intended outcomes of the training in clear, measurable terms. Well-defined objectives guide both the design of the curriculum and the evaluation of success, ensuring that participants gain the knowledge or skills the training set out to provide.

- **Curriculum development:** Design a structured curriculum that aligns with the learning objectives. This includes selecting the content, sequencing topics logically, determining the balance between theory and practice, and integrating activities or exercises that reinforce learning.

- **[Learning paths](../resources/learning-paths.md):** Review related learning paths to see how this training complements or fits into broader programmes. Decide whether the training is standalone or part of a sequence, and ensure it follows any established guidelines or standards for learning progression.

- **[Train the Trainer](../resources/train-the-trainer.md):** Support the development of trainers who will deliver the course. This includes providing guidance, resources, and opportunities to practice teaching methods, ensuring that trainers can effectively facilitate learning and maintain consistent quality across sessions.


## What are the logistical aspects?

* **Budgeting and Resource Allocation**: Determine the financial resources required and available for the training. Consider potential funding sources and establish a clear budget plan.
* **Trainer selection**: Identifying qualified trainers within the community and establishing a training team that can include hired trainers or not, appoint a course leader if needed. 
* **Trainer recruitment**:  Recruitment processes to hire new trainers when applicable. 
* **Size of training team for one training**: Might vary according e.g. to the number of participants, format of training, audience level, etc. Ideally a minimum of two trainers are available per training for good support and backup for unforeseen events.
* **Training format and delivery**: Selecting the most appropriate format (e.g., classroom, online, blended) and delivery method and training schedule (e.g.: duration, spread of lessons, time of offering) according to level, audience availability and topic.
* **Preliminary logistical arrangements**: Planning for venue, equipment, and other available general resources for participants during the training session (e.g. restaurantes, meeting rooms, break rooms, etc …) that might have  logistical requirements in order to establish budget etc. 
* **Marketing and promotion**: Developing or integrating to already existing  communication strategies to attract and inform potential participants.
* **Code of Conduct**: Establish a code of conduct for training events to adhere to
* **Evaluate**: Developing or reusing already existing strategies to l evaluate the training and include that in your plan.
