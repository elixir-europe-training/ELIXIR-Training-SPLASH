This stage encompasses both pedagogical, logistical and organization steps, with a primary focus on didactics. These tasks are divided into arrangements and planning required before, during, and after training delivery. Revisit the plan, design and develop outcomes and take into account decisions made during the previous stages when initiating delivery.

From a pedagogical perspective, communicating with participants by providing and gathering necessary information, and sharing pre-course materials is essential for a smooth start. Trainers must align didactic strategies, and ensure training and training material and course accessibility for everyone (colorblind, dyslexic, physical disabilities, etc). The training should be adaptable and interactive. Breaks and informal interactions contribute to engagement and learning. Gathering feedback is important to plan future improvements. Each step is crucial to ensure an effective and inclusive learning experience.

Logistical tasks include selecting a venue or technical platform, ensuring accessibility and technical setup, announcements and registering participants, arranging catering for in-person events, creating and organizing documents such as surveys and prints, in addition to the digital resources storage and sharing strategies.

## What are the pedagogical aspects?

**Before the training event**:
* Participant selection assessment: Define criteria for prioritization and assessment of trainees application in order to select participants that can benefit the most from the training and training format.
* Didactics: Align strategy based on the pre-course survey and needed resources to enable and facilitate learning
* Accessibility: Check with participants and trainers if they have special needs (dyslexia, color blindness, etc …)
* Trainer-the-trainer: When needed trainers must take the course in advance to update, improve or learn the theory of teaching and some strategies.
* Trainer setup: It is preferable to teach in partnership, that allows for more support to trainees. However you must consider the delivery format and learning experiences to define an ideal number of trainers and trainees. Conduct a pre-course meeting with collaborators to align expectations and address any questions, define roles, align time, didactic strategies, ...
  
**During the training event**:
* Ice breaker: Introduce trainers and start with an ice breaker activity to enhance engagement.
* Interactive: Deliver course content in an interactive and variable manner to increase learning opportunities..
* Adapt: Monitor the participant engagement and address questions promptly and adapt instructions and content to meet learner needs. 
* Practical Exercises: Provide clear written instructions for hands-on exercises and offer guidance and support to participants as needed.
* Assessments: Conduct formative or summative assessments, such as quizzes, learner reflections or assignments, to evaluate learning. 

**After the training event**:
* Update material: Based on feedback, reflections and evaluations. Plan for how to update the material and plan for delivery for the next iteration.

## What are the logistical aspects?

This is not an exhaustive listing of items to consider.

**Before the training event**:

*Venue and Catering*:
* Venue: Secure a suitable venue with appropriate facilities. Visit the venue to try out the technical set-up, arrange access cards and signs to find the room etc.
* Accessibility: Check with participants and trainers if they have special needs.
* Catering: Arrange catering services, considering dietary requirements and preferences.

*Registrations*
* Registration: Set up a registration process that collects information needed to select participants or define clearly that this is a “first come - first serve” setup.
Consider collecting demographic data for future analysis. Make sure to protect sensitive data and participant information.

*Course technical resources*:

Technical considerations for online or hybrid events:

* Online helper: Breakout rooms, technical checks for online resources
* Compute resources: Prepare access to compute resources, learning management systems, collaborative notes documents, notebooks, …
* Prepare any non-digital resource
