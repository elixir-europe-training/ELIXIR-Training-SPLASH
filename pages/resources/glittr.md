description: |
   Glittr.org is a manually curated database of Git repositories, which enables users to find educational materials that would otherwise be hard to identify.

objective: |
  With the application, users can search and compare educational materials based on topic and author, but also on engagement metrics such as stargazers (bookmarks) and recency (days since last commit). This allows users to find high-quality and up-to-date materials that are actively maintained by their authors.
