#OPTIONAL FIELDS
mission: |
  TeSS was originally developed as part of ELIXIR, Europe's distributed infrastructure for life-science data. One of the goals of ELIXIR is to train research scientists to better use available computational infrastructures to address critical research questions. This requires access both to face-to-face training opportunities and to disparate training materials and resources, currently dispersed across Europe.

benefit: |
  - wider promotion of training events
  - better sharing of materials and event information
  - easier identification of relevant training events and resources
