    For the finetuning of our yearly training programme, TeSS is a valuable resource of inspiration. As a one stop shop for not-only European events and materials for life sciences training, I can get an overview of the recent offerings of many training providers via easy searches or faceted filters. This enables me to finetune our yearly training programme and identify potential external trainers for training sessions where we do not have internal experts. VIB Training provides its training events and training material to TeSS since more than 7 years.

    As part of the XV Einstein Telescope Symposium, we developed a FAIR Learning Path for Gravitational Wave Science, based on direct application of the ELIXIR Learning Paths Protocol. As participants in the ELIXIR Learning Paths workshop series, it was a great opportunity for us to transfer all the knowledge and resources gathered there to the Astronomy and Astrophysics domain.
