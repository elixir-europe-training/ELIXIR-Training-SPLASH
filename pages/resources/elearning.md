description: |
  The ELIXIR e-Learning Interest Group is a pan-European community of experts and practitioners in e-learning for bioinformatics and life sciences. Meeting monthly, the group provides a platform to share and discuss best practices for e-learning content creation, curation, and standardization across ELIXIR Nodes and Communities. Key topics include developing and curating high-quality, interactive, and sustainable e-learning resources; and promoting interoperability and reuse—especially through initiatives like TeSS and the adoption of standards. The interest group helps to drive the FAIRification and harmonization of training material and offers a space for Nodes and Communities to align their strategies and get up to speed with modern educational approaches, including Learning Management Systems and hybrid learning.
objective: |
  * Exchange and recommend best practices for e-learning material creation and implementation (e.g., interactivity, accessibility, maintainability, open access)
  * Define and improve curation processes for e-learning content, especially for inclusion in the TeSS training registry
  * Participate in collaborative development and sharing of e-learning resources across the ELIXIR network
