description: |
   Learning Paths are pathways that guide the learner through a set of learning courses or materials to be undertaken progressively to acquire the desired knowledge and skills on a subject. Establishing and implementing Learning Paths will facilitate the learning process in any professional trajectory and career path.
objective: |
  The main aims of the ELIXIR Learning Paths project are:
  * Develop guidelines and best practices on how to create Learning Paths
  * Implement Learning Paths across different communities
  * Raise awareness on the pedagogical aspects and promote their adoption
  * Establish a community of practice to share knowledge, experiences, and ideas
