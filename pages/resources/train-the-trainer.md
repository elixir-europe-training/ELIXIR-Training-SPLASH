description: |
  One of the ELIXIR Training Platform’s objectives is to increase bioinformatics capacity and competency in Europe. This programme, established in collaboration with GOBLET, relies in the development of Train-the-Trainer (TtT) courses and materials, and fosters a network of trainers, the TtT instructor's community, to allow them to benefit from reciprocal support and exchange of experiences.  

objective: |
  The programme objective is to give instructors tools and tips for providing an enriching learning experience to trainees, irrespective of topic, and to include best-practice guidance on course and training material development.
