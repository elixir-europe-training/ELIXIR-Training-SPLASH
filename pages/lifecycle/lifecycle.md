## What is the training life cycle?

Training in the life sciences often follows a structured path from identifying needs to evaluating impact. This is called a training life cycle. It helps training providers to plan, design, develop, deliver, and evaluate training activities effectively in order to create high-quality, sustainable training.

[**Plan**](plan): In this stage, the training needs are identified and assessed to determine whether training is needed and what needs to be trained. This stage helps ensure that the training results in what is desired and intended.

[**Design**](design): After the training needs have been identified and the objectives determined, an effective method of training can be designed. This stage includes determining the best method of delivery which may include instructor-led, online, self-study, or a blended method.

[**Develop**](develop): In this stage, the materials including job aides, activities, presentations, and assessments can be developed, and the training material assets will be created and stored on a training material repository or an e-learning platform.

[**Deliver**](deliver): This stage focusses on the delivery of the training which includes many logistical aspects like registration, advertisment as well as the actual execution of the course in a synchronuous manner of asynchronuously if an e-learning course is delivered. 

[**Evaluate**](evaluate): After the individuals have had a chance to apply the learning, the effectiveness of the training should be assessed and those findings integrated into an overall evaluation and review process to allow improvements to the training program.
